        <h2>Our diets</h2>
        <p>
            We offer a wide variety of diets for you to choose from. Not only do we have dry and wet food options, we
            have organic options. We can offer selections based on allergies that you inform us about. We also have a
            large treat selection, so you can tell us what your furry friend enjoys the most!
        </p>
        <h2>Our Play Area</h2>
        <p>
            Our play area is second to none. We offer a large fenced in yard for your pet to run to their heart's content.
            We have a safe pool for your pet to use if they like, while under our supervision. Sleeping comfort will never
            be a doubt! We have the softest beds money can buy.
        </p>
        <h2>Your pet is the star</h2>
        <p>
            Your pet(s) will be the only guest(s) here at the time you selected for your reservation. All of our attention
            will be devoted to make sure your pet(s) feel like the family members they are.
